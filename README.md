What is a Network Packet?
--------------------------
A network packet is a small unit of data transmitted over a network. It typically consists of:

Header: Contains control information, such as source and destination IP addresses, port numbers, and protocol type.
Payload: Contains the actual data being transmitted.


How Does a Packet Sniffer Work?
--------------------------------
A packet sniffer works by:

Capturing packets: The sniffer captures network packets from a network interface, such as an Ethernet card or a Wi-Fi adapter.
Analyzing packets: The sniffer analyzes the captured packets, extracting information such as source and destination IP addresses, port numbers, and protocol type.
Displaying packet information: The sniffer displays the analyzed packet information in a user-friendly format.


Types of Packet Sniffers
--------------------------
There are two primary types of packet sniffers:

Passive sniffers: These sniffers capture packets without injecting any traffic into the network.
Active sniffers: These sniffers inject traffic into the network to stimulate packet capture.


Packet Sniffer Tools
--------------------
Some popular packet sniffer tools include:

Wireshark: A free, open-source packet sniffer with a graphical user interface.
Tcpdump: A free, open-source packet sniffer with a command-line interface.
Microsoft Network Monitor: A free packet sniffer with a graphical user interface.


Use Cases for Packet Sniffers
-----------------------------
Packet sniffers are useful in various scenarios, such as:

Network troubleshooting: Identifying connectivity issues, packet loss, or latency problems.
Security monitoring: Detecting potential security threats, such as malware or unauthorized access attempts.
Network optimization: Analyzing network performance and optimizing network configuration.


Packet Sniffer Features
-----------------------
Some common features of packet sniffers include:

Packet filtering: Filtering packets based on specific criteria, such as protocol type or source IP address.
Packet analysis: Analyzing packet contents, such as data and headers.
Packet display: Displaying packet information in a user-friendly format.
